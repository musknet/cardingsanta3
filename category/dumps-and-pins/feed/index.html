<p class="has-text-align-center">Welcome Carders, For those of you who don&#8217;t know, &#8220;dumps&#8221; are stolen credit card information that is encoded onto a new card, and &#8220;cloning&#8221; is the process of duplicating this information onto a blank card. </p>



<p>This type of fraud is becoming increasingly common, so I thought it would be helpful to share some tips on how to avoid becoming a victim. Keep reading to learn more about how these scams work and what you can do to protect yourself.</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center">Cloned Cards? Video</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="https://cardingsecrets.su/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Untitled1.mp4"></video></figure>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center">Summary</h2>



<p>Carding is a growing industry and learning the basics can get you well on your way to taking advantage of it. Dumps and Cloned Cards are two of the most popular tools used for Carding, and in this video I&#8217;ll break down how they work. In short, a cloned card is an exact copy of an existing credit card. You can use it for all the same things, like withdrawing money from ATMs or making large purchases at stores. </p>



<p>The benefit of buying from a vendor like <a href="https://777dumps.su" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">777dumps.su<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> is that you don&#8217;t have to worry about getting all the software, hardware and other equipment yourself. However, if you&#8217;re savvy enough to get dumps yourself by skimming them (a process where you physically skim cards), then you don&#8217;t need to wait 72 hours for cards to be shipped out &#8211; plus it&#8217;s free! But be aware that getting the right equipment needed for Carding can set you back around $1500 &amp; the feds hate people that skim even more than people that cash out the dumps.</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center">Skimming Vs Cashing out dumps : The law</h2>



<p>Skimming: According to the law, This crime is considered to be more serious than cashing out card details, because it involves deceptive theft on an even larger scale. Instead of obtaining card details from one cardholder at a time; skimming dumps involve collecting data from multiple cardholders in one go with the help of an illegal card readers. </p>



<h3 class="has-text-align-center">prevent card cloning</h3>



<p>It&#8217;s easy for criminals to take advantage of cluttered public spaces like subway stations and retail stores to break into card Readers unnoticed, making them even more damaging to unsuspecting customers who have their bank accounts compromised. To protect yourself from this type of crime, make sure you stay away from any suspicious card readers in public areas, and if necessary use specialized protective devices like Anti-Skim Covers wherever appropriate.</p>

<p>In the world of cybercrime, Carding is king. This illegal activity—which involves using stolen or counterfeit credit cards to make online purchases—is extremely lucrative, and it&#8217;s only getting more popular as time goes on. If you&#8217;re new to the world of carding, you might be wondering how it&#8217;s done. Today, we&#8217;re going to take a look at dump + pin carding, one of the most popular methods of carding. We&#8217;ll discuss what a dump + pin is, how to get your hands on one, and how to use it for maximum profit</p>



<h2>What Is a Dump + pin ?</h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img  decoding="async" width="638" height="264" src="data:image/gif,GIF89a%01%00%01%00%80%00%00%00%00%00%FF%FF%FF%21%F9%04%01%00%00%00%00%2C%00%00%00%00%01%00%01%00%00%02%01D%00%3B" data-layzr="https://cardingsecrets.su/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/types-of-credit-cards-incarding-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4740"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">dumps and pins carding</figcaption></figure></div>


<p class="has-text-align-center"><br>You probably have heard of dumps cvv&#8217;s before.<br>Dumps &amp; Pins are typically acquired through skimming devices that are placed on ATMs or gas station pumps.<br>Once a criminal has skimmed enough information from unsuspecting victims, they can sell the dumps on the internet&#8217;s black marketplaces for example: <a href="https://777dumps.su" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">777<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a><a href="https://777dumps.su" target="_blank" rel="noopener external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">dumps.su<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>



<p>Cardholders are protected, any time they find out their credit card has been stolen, the banks refund the stolen money, the banks can just print the money with one push on a button; This is the main reason why most carders do not feel guilty whilst getting rich.</p>



<p>Dump carding is a type of fraud that involves cloning a credit or debit card and using the cloned card to withdraw cash or make purchases. </p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">How do credit card shops collect the dump card data?</p>



<ul>
<li>One common method is called <strong>skimming</strong>. Skimming involves using a device called a skimmer to copy the data from the magnetic stripe &amp; or EMV chip of a credit or debit card. This data is then encoded onto a blank card and used to withdraw cash from ATMs or make purchases.</li>



<li>The second method Credit Card stores collect CC information is by <strong>Hacking</strong>/<strong>Malware/Botnets</strong> infecting payment devices.</li>



<li>Another common method the credit card shops collect credit card information is by <strong>phishing</strong>. Phishing involves tricking someone into giving you their credit or debit card information. This can be done by sending an email that looks like it&#8217;s from a bank or credit card company, asking for account information.</li>
</ul>



<p>Once you have the credit or debit card information, you can use it to withdraw cash from ATMs or make purchases. But what if your country only accepts CC&#8217;s with <strong>EMV </strong>chips (track 2) for transactions?</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center">What is EMV? </h2>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The <strong>EMV </strong>chip (track 2) has been a thorn in the side of carders for years.</p>



<p>EMV stands for <strong>Europay, MasterCard® and Visa®</strong> and refers to the increased security of payment card transactions. <br><br><strong>EMV </strong>chips are chips that are embedded in modern credit and debit cards. These chips store information that is used to authenticate transactions. While <strong>EMV </strong>chips make it more difficult to clone cards, they are not impossible to bypass.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size"><em>a little history lesson on <strong>shimming</strong>:</em> <br><code><em>In the past carders would get around emv security by <strong>shimming</strong>. <strong>Shimming </strong>involves destroying the <strong>EMV </strong>chip, either by burning, scratching with knife, water / electronical damage etc, this would automatically cause the payment terminal to skip the emv chip &amp; read the magnetic strip accepting the transaction. </em>(the Shimming method does not work anymore so dont waste your valuable time.)</code></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size"><em><strong>The end of shimming</strong> &amp; the <strong>start of emv skimming</strong></em></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size"><em>Global Credit card fraud accounted for losses of $56.13 billion for 2023, That was a 79% increase from 2023.  this woke the regulators up, they started taking notice.</em></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size"><em>It did not take the regulators long to come up with a tactic</em>.<br> so what did they change to <em>the payment structure/system? well, the following: <strong>EMV chip broken? transaction cancelled</strong>.<br>whilst before the payment terminal would automatically switch to read the magnetic stripe, in 2023 the payment automatically gets aborted on a malfunctioning emv chip.<br>&amp; yes, you guessed it: as always carders have found a way to <strong>bypass </strong>this security measure.</em></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Do you remember what i told you about <strong>skimming</strong>?<strong> </strong><br><strong>Skimmed EMV data</strong> (track2) can also be encoded onto a blank card &amp; be used to make fraudulent purchases/cash withdrawals. </p>

<p>Recommended dump + pin Store: <a href="https://777dumps.su" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">777dumps.su<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a></p>



<p>For those in the know, ATM hackers and carders are two sides of the same coin. Working together, they can both reap lucrative rewards – as long as they stay one step ahead of law enforcement. Dump sites like wcc-plug.su provide a marketplace for customers to buy Clone cards &amp; Virtual cards that allow them to convert their stolen data into hard cash. Dumps plus pins, known simply as D+P, are the name given to a collection of credit card data obtained illegally from compromised ATMs or POS systems. This information includes Track 1 and Track 2 data along with the associated PIN number used for authentication when withdrawing funds from an ATM.</p>



<p>To carry out this scheme successfully, criminals must have access to specialist equipment like an Omnikey card reader, a magnetic strip reader (MSR) and blank cards that they can buy from sites such as Amazon.com. With these tools in place, D+P’s are created and sold on the dark web for thousands of dollars – depending on the quality – to customers who then use them to withdraw money from ATMs around the world.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="https://cardingsecrets.su/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/How-carders-atm-hackers-work-together.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>By working together ATM hackers and carders have managed to create a win-win situation – but it’s also important to remember that their activities are illegal and could land them in serious trouble with law enforcement. If you’re considering getting involved with D+P schemes, think twice; it may be tempting but it is definitely not a risk free endeavor.</p>



<p>For those with the right connections, Dumps plus Pins (D+P) are an easy way to make money fast – but they’re not without risks. D+P is a combination of illegally obtained credit card data and associated PIN numbers that are often gathered from compromised ATMs or POS systems. This data is then sold on the dark web in exchange for hard cash; sites like wcc-plug.su offer Clone cards &amp; Virtual cards that allow customers to convert D+P into cold, hard cash – at least until law enforcement catches up with them.</p>



<p>In order for criminals to successfully carry out D+P scams, they must have access to specialist equipment like an Omnikey card reader, a magnetic strip reader (MSR) and blank cards that can be ordered from sites such as Amazon.com. With these tools in place D+P’s are created and sold on the dark web for thousands of dollars – depending on the quality – to customers who then use them to withdraw money from ATMs around the world.</p>



<p>By working together Dumps plus PIN scams have become incredibly lucrative; however it must be remembered that this is an illegal activity and one fraught with serious risks. Making fast money may seem tempting but if you’re not careful enough you could end up facing heavy fines or even jail time. So before getting involved with D+P schemes make sure you understand the risks involved. </p>
