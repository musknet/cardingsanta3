<h2 class="has-text-align-center">Billing is Shipping</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Since you are a carder, it&#8217;s always a good idea to be aware of the security measures that payment providers have in place. </p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">One such measure is to check whether the cardholder&#8217;s location matches the: </p>



<ul>
<li>billing and shipping address for <strong>Secured cards</strong></li>



<li>billing and shipping country <strong>Non vbv/Msc Cards</strong> (<a href="https://cardingsecrets.su/what-is-a-non-vbv-card/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">what is a non vbv cc?</a>) (<a href="https://cardingsecrets.su/how-to-get-a-non-vbv-card/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">how do i get a non vbv c</a>c?)</li>
</ul>



<p><em>Billing address = the physical address of the cardholder, <a href="https://wcc-plug.su" target="_blank" rel="noopener external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">WCC <span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>always supplies you with this.<br>Shipping address = your <a href="https://cardingsecrets.su/how-to-get-a-drop-address/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">drop address</a> where the package will be delivered. <a href="https://cardingsecrets.su/how-to-get-a-drop-address/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">(what is a drop address?</a>)</em></p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center">Physical Items</h2>



<p>When carding physical items, shipping location can make or break your carding attempt. Many online stores, such as <a href="https://amazon.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Amazon<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, <a href="http://apple.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">Apple<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, Walmart and more check to see if the cardholder country matches the shipping address country. </p>



<p>This is why carders use the <strong>billing=shipping method</strong>: so that the cardholder’s country matches the shipping address country and there is less chance of the order being cancelled. So if you are carding physical items, it pays off to pay attention to where your cc is located for a successful carding attempt!</p>



<h3 class="has-text-align-center"><a href="https://cardingsecrets.su/nft-carding-method/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Carding Digital Items</a>/<a href="https://cardingsecrets.su/category/carding-methods/money-transfer-carding/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Money Transfers</a>/<a href="https://cardingsecrets.su/category/carding-methods/bitcoin-carding/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Cryptocurrencies</a></h3>



<p>When carding money transfers or cryptocurrencies, it doesn&#8217;t really matter since there is no shipping address; matching up the cardholder&#8217;s IP to their country of origin is usually enough.</p>



<p>So carders, remember to be mindful of cc location when carding physical items! It could mean the difference between a successful carding attempt and a failed one. Happy carding! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center">Update: Billing = Shipping Bypass</h2>



<h3 class="has-text-align-center">SEND AS GIFT</h3>



<p>don&#8217;t worry &#8211; there is an easy way to bypass this: simply tick the &#8216;send as gift&#8217; box when checking out. If the site gives you an option to write a gift message, even better! That way, the payment provider no longer has any incentive to do its usual billing = shipping security check.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img  decoding="async" width="480" height="480" src="data:image/gif,GIF89a%01%00%01%00%80%00%00%00%00%00%FF%FF%FF%21%F9%04%01%00%00%00%00%2C%00%00%00%00%01%00%01%00%00%02%01D%00%3B" data-layzr="https://cardingsecrets.su/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/amazon_standard_delete_large.webp" alt="billing is shipping gift" class="wp-image-5728" data-layzr-srcset="https://cardingsecrets.su/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/amazon_standard_delete_large.webp 480w, https://cardingsecrets.su/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/amazon_standard_delete_large-300x300.webp 300w, https://cardingsecrets.su/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/amazon_standard_delete_large-150x150.webp 150w, https://cardingsecrets.su/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/amazon_standard_delete_large-80x80.webp 80w, https://cardingsecrets.su/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/amazon_standard_delete_large-60x60.webp 60w, https://cardingsecrets.su/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/amazon_standard_delete_large-200x200.webp 200w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></figure></div>


<p>Another benefit of sending as a gift is that receiving your package won&#8217;t seem like such a big crime anymore &#8211; anyone could have sent it! So next time you card online, remember this simple trick and you&#8217;ll be carding like a pro in no time.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Welcome Carders, For those of you who don&#8217;t know, &#8220;dumps&#8221; are stolen credit card information that is encoded onto a new card, and &#8220;cloning&#8221; is the process of duplicating this information onto a blank card. </p>



<p>This type of fraud is becoming increasingly common, so I thought it would be helpful to share some tips on how to avoid becoming a victim. Keep reading to learn more about how these scams work and what you can do to protect yourself.</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center">Cloned Cards? Video</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="https://cardingsecrets.su/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Untitled1.mp4"></video></figure>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center">Summary</h2>



<p>Carding is a growing industry and learning the basics can get you well on your way to taking advantage of it. Dumps and Cloned Cards are two of the most popular tools used for Carding, and in this video I&#8217;ll break down how they work. In short, a cloned card is an exact copy of an existing credit card. You can use it for all the same things, like withdrawing money from ATMs or making large purchases at stores. </p>



<p>The benefit of buying from a vendor like <a href="https://777dumps.su" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">777dumps.su<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> is that you don&#8217;t have to worry about getting all the software, hardware and other equipment yourself. However, if you&#8217;re savvy enough to get dumps yourself by skimming them (a process where you physically skim cards), then you don&#8217;t need to wait 72 hours for cards to be shipped out &#8211; plus it&#8217;s free! But be aware that getting the right equipment needed for Carding can set you back around $1500 &amp; the feds hate people that skim even more than people that cash out the dumps.</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center">Skimming Vs Cashing out dumps : The law</h2>



<p>Skimming: According to the law, This crime is considered to be more serious than cashing out card details, because it involves deceptive theft on an even larger scale. Instead of obtaining card details from one cardholder at a time; skimming dumps involve collecting data from multiple cardholders in one go with the help of an illegal card readers. </p>



<h3 class="has-text-align-center">prevent card cloning</h3>



<p>It&#8217;s easy for criminals to take advantage of cluttered public spaces like subway stations and retail stores to break into card Readers unnoticed, making them even more damaging to unsuspecting customers who have their bank accounts compromised. To protect yourself from this type of crime, make sure you stay away from any suspicious card readers in public areas, and if necessary use specialized protective devices like Anti-Skim Covers wherever appropriate.</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center">the art of turning blank cards to cloned cards.</h2>

<h2>Not Using Dedicated Carding Tools:</h2>



<p>Many carders fail to use dedicated carding tools, such as <a href="https://cardingsecrets.su/faq/#How_do_i_check_the_card_balance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Balance checkers</a> and <a href="https://cardingsecrets.su/category/carding-tools/carding-software/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Automated Carding software.</a> These tools are designed to help you quickly identify valid cards and avoid scams.

<h2>Not Knowing Enough Carding Methods:</h2>

<h2>Not Stocking Up on Enough CC&#8217;s:</h2>



<p>When it comes to carding, having a good supply of Non vbv cards is essential. Carders need to make sure they get enough cards from <a href="https://wcc-plug.su" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">wcc-plug.su<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a> before they start carding, so that they don&#8217;t run out after other people have already bought all the cards. Being one step ahead is an important part of the carding game. Carders should also familiarize themselves with different carding methods, so that they can choose the one that works best for them. After all, if you don&#8217;t have the right supplies and knowledge, it&#8217;s hard to succeed when you&#8217;re carding. So make sure to get a good supply of Non vbv cards and learn the carding methods before you start your carding journey. Good luck!</p>



<h2>5. <a href="https://cardingsecrets.su/how-to-stay-anonymous/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Not Staying Anonymous</a>: </h2>



<p>It&#8217;s important to remain anonymous when carding so that the Feds (Cyber Police) cannot trace you back to the carder activities. Make sure to use a VPN and other anonymization tools, so you can stay safe online. <a href="https://cardingsecrets.su/how-to-stay-anonymous/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">click here for a guide on staying anonymous</a></p>



<h2>Not Knowing the Law: </h2>



<p>Carding isn&#8217;t exactly legal in most parts of the world. Make sure you&#8217;re aware of all of your local laws before engaging in any carder activities so that you can stay on the right side of the law. </p>



<h2>Not Being Patient: </h2>



<p>When it comes to making payments, never copy and paste your Credit Card information. It may seem like a convenient way of speeding up the process but Credit Card security systems are highly advanced and will detect pasting information, resulting in a rejected payment. Always manually enter your Credit Card information for safe and secure payments. Don&#8217;t take the risk of your payment being denied &#8211; enter it manually! It&#8217;s the safest way to guarantee a successful payment. So the next time you&#8217;re making a payment, remember: no copy and pasting! Enter it manually for safe and secure payments every time.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Patience is key when it comes to carding. Don&#8217;t rush through transactions and make sure that you take your time so that everything goes smoothly and safely.</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center">To sum it up:</h2>



<p>By following these tips, you can avoid making the common mistakes carders make and ensure that your activities stay safe, secure, and successful. Make sure to stay aware of the risks and rewards, always practice safe carding habits. Good luck out there!</p>

<p>Debit Fullz and Debit Linkable contain the regular credit card information, but what makes them stand out is the additional info included, such as Social Security Number, Date of Birth, Driver&#8217;s License number (sometimes), phone number and more. This is why Debit Fullz / Linkable are so important for successful Carding Cashouts.</p>

<p>When it comes to Money Transfer &amp; Crypto Carding, there&#8217;s no better option than a Fullz cc. Carders know that Money Transfer &amp; Crypto sites always ask for extra information such as date of birth and social security number &#8211; so a Fullz cc is the only way to cash out.</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center">Physical carding</h2>



<p>However, these Carding Debit Fullz / Linkable are not required when it comes to Cashouts from <a href="https://cardingsecrets.su/category/carding-methods/online-store-carding/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Online Stores</a>,<a href="https://cardingsecrets.su/category/carding-methods/designer-clothing-carding/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"> Designer Clothing stores</a>, Games &amp; Lifestyle service sites such as<a href="https://cardingsecrets.su/dominos-pizza-carding-method/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"> Dominos</a>/<a href="https://cardingsecrets.su/airbnb-carding-method" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Airbnb</a> and <a href="https://cardingsecrets.su/category/carding-methods/betting-carding-method/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Betting Sites</a>. So if you’re Carding for physical items, you don&#8217;t need to use Debit Fullz or Debit Linkables.</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center">Summary</h2>

<h2 class="has-text-align-center">Intro</h2>



<p>There are many different techniques when it comes to carding, but one of the most important decisions you will make is which type of CVV to use. In this video, we will discuss the pros and cons of using a CVV2 vs a fullz CVV. We will also show you how to get around the new Visa security measures, so you can continue carding without any problems!</p>



<p>CVV2 stands for Card Verification Value 2 and is the standard type of CVV used when you make an online purchase. It consists of three digits on the back of your card, and it helps to verify that you are the legitimate owner of the card. This security measure has been in place since 2003 and provides a level of additional protection when making purchases online.</p>



<p>Fullz CVV, on the other hand, is a type of carding that requires more information than just the three digits found on the back of your card. Fullz includes all the information associated with an account, such as name, address, date of birth, and security questions. This type of carding provides a higher level of security for online purchases but also increases the risk for fraudsters.</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center">CVV2 vs Fullz basics Tutorial Video</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="https://cardingsecrets.su/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/CVV-vs-FULZ1.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>When it comes to which type of CVV is better for carding purposes, it really depends on what you&#8217;re trying to do. If you want to make standard online purchases, a cvv is enough, if you want to be able to make larger purchases (<a href="https://cardingsecrets.su/category/carding-methods/bitcoin-carding/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Crypto</a>,<a href="https://cardingsecrets.su/apple-carding-method-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Macbooks</a> etc&#8230;) without triggering any red flags from banks or credit companies then fullz may be your best option. With non vbv fullz, you can bypass the new Visa security measures and make purchases without any issues.</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center">Outro</h2>



<p>While both CVV2 and Fullz have their pros and cons, it ultimately comes down to your individual needs as a carder. If you are looking for more robust protection when making online purchases, then Fullz is definitely the way to go. However, if you want an easier way to make quick purchases with minimal risk, then CVV2 may be your best option. Ultimately, it&#8217;s up to you to decide which is better for carding purposes. Good luck!</p>

<p></p>



<p>When carding, you need to consider how you will receive your items. It&#8217;s important to find a reliable and secure way to receive the carded items so you can remain discreet. A great way to achieve this is by having the carded items sent as a gift, allowing you to ship them worldwide without the risk of being flagged.</p>



<p>When selecting a drop address, make sure to choose one that meets all requirements, such as never using your own address or having any cameras on the premises. To ensure the carded items are delivered quickly and safely, include a delivery note that reads: &#8220;Do not ring the bell, do not give the package to my neighbors, please drop the package at the front door&#8221;. This way you can be sure your carded items will arrive securely and without any suspicion.</p>



<p><br><img  decoding="async" width="573" height="160" class="wp-image-715" style="width: 600px;" src="data:image/gif,GIF89a%01%00%01%00%80%00%00%00%00%00%FF%FF%FF%21%F9%04%01%00%00%00%00%2C%00%00%00%00%01%00%01%00%00%02%01D%00%3B" data-layzr="https://cardingsecrets.su/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/adddddddd.png" alt=""></p>



<p>By taking the right precautions and using the proper methods, carding can be a secure and efficient way to get the items you need. So make sure to use the right drop address and delivery notes when carding and you’ll be able to receive your carded items without any issues. ~~~Good luck carders!~~~.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center" id="how-do-i-know-when-to-pick-up-my-gift">How do i stay discreet?</h2>



<p>If you want to be discreet about your gift pick up, carding is the way to go. Look for a drop address that won&#8217;t draw suspicion and use it for your shipping address. Drug addict homes are perfect for delivering packages discreetly, as they often don&#8217;t pay close attention to who is coming and going. With carding, you can track your shipment without anyone else knowing about it. When the delivery window nears, wait near the drop address and pick up your gift when the courier leaves. That way you can keep your surprise a secret! Remember to keep your carding activities discreet and shop smart! Good luck! ​​​​</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center">Addict Drop addresses</h2>



<p>Drug addicts are increasingly becoming involved in carding activities, often providing their homes as drop addresses. This creates a safe haven for carders to receive illegal goods without being detected by law enforcement. Drug dealers often let Carders use these drop addresses to receive stolen goods. It is important for carders to keep these drop addresses hidden and secure, as any evidence found there could prove disastrous. Drug addicts are often willing to cooperate, as carders &amp; dealers provide them with money and drugs in return for their assistance. This dangerous agreement has become increasingly popular among carding circles, and carders are willing to take the risk of using drop addresses provided by addicts. With both sides having something to gain, carding activities have become a lucrative business for drug dealers and carders alike.</p>



<p>The use of drop addresses is a vital part of carding activities, as it allows carders to stay one step ahead of the law. It is important for carders to take extra precautions when using drop addresses, as any evidence found there can lead to serious legal repercussions. Drug addicts are willing to cooperate and provide drop addresses in exchange for money and drugs, but carders must remain vigilant when using them, as drug addicts are not to be trusted. By staying aware of the risks, carders can protect themselves and their illicit activities from law enforcement.</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center" id="method-1-acting-like-you-are-away"><strong>&#8220;Im at work&#8221;</strong></h2>



<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a way to card without having to be present when the delivery arrives, you can use this sneaky method: leaving a note on the door with a &#8220;signature&#8221; and an order confirmation page with your drop address&#8217;s tracking number. Sign the note, stick it in the door, and wait in your car not far from the place. When the driver leaves the package, you can quickly make off with it without anyone being the wiser. So if you&#8217;re looking to card items without being physically present, leave a note with your drop address and tracking number on the door – and card with confidence.</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center" id="method-2-acting-like-you-own-the-place">&#8220;Fake it till you take it&#8221;</h2>



<p>When you receive the carding package, make sure to get it delivered at a drop address. This way, you can avoid any suspicion from law enforcement and protect your carding activities. The second method of delivery is when the package requires a signature upon arrival. Make sure to meet with the driver in person and have all necessary documents ready. It&#8217;s important to remember that the driver is not there to investigate carding fraud. All you need to do is make them believe the package is yours and they won&#8217;t question anything else. Carry a printout of the order confirmation page, have the tracking number open on your phone, and look like you&#8217;ve been waiting for it. When waiting at the drop, sit on the front lawn or do whatever you need to look like it&#8217;s your package. Be discreet and keep carding activities secret. With these steps, you&#8217;ll be able to receive carding packages without facing any suspicion. Good luck!</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center" id="after-getting-your-package"><strong>After getting your package</strong></h2>



<p>Once you have your carded item in hand, take extra precautions to ensure that no one can trace it back to you. Drive to a nearby park or public place and open the cardboard packaging. Carefully inspect for any device that could be tracking your position such as bugs, GPS devices or anything else suspicious. Once you are certain that there are no tracking devices, destroy the shipping label and throw away the cardboard packaging. If you decided to card through a drop address, don&#8217;t forget to burn the order confirmation page after you do this. Now your precious carded item is all yours, with nobody able to trace it back to you! This is just one of the many methods of carding that can be used to get what you want with your non vbv card &#8211; and now, you&#8217;re one step closer to enjoying the freedom it brings. </p>



<p>Now you are carding like a pro and have burnt a drop to a crisp. Keep in mind that it&#8217;s important to never go back to the same drop address again &#8211; carding is a game of &#8216;hit and run&#8217;. Get as much as you can out of each card, then burn it, but be sure to keep your identity hidden so you can card again. Brag about your successful carding online, but remember that discretion is key &#8211; carding is not something to be taken lightly! With a bit of luck and the right strategy, you can make some serious money from carding. Good luck!</p>



<p>Happy carding!</p>

<p>Hello and welcome to this new <a href="HTTPS://WCC-AUTOSHOP.CC" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">wcc service for <strong>SMS verification</strong>.</a> If you are carding using proxies, you can easily change location in order to visit a certain site but what about the phone number you will use to register. It’s expensive to buy a single phone number <strong>and only use it once</strong>. Also, most free sites offering online SMS verification got many users and its also hard to find a phone number which has <strong>not been used</strong>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  decoding="async" width="1024" height="544" src="data:image/gif,GIF89a%01%00%01%00%80%00%00%00%00%00%FF%FF%FF%21%F9%04%01%00%00%00%00%2C%00%00%00%00%01%00%01%00%00%02%01D%00%3B" data-layzr="https://cardingsecrets.su/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Carding-phone-number-service-1024x544.png" alt="Carding phone number service button" class="wp-image-1849"/></figure>



<p>In order to help our users, get through this, we have hundreds of phone numbers in many countries, they are not free to the public though, since we pay for them. You will only be able to use them if you are a <a href="HTTPS://WCC-AUTOSHOP.CC" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">wcc </a>user who have bought at least one item or has a balance in our site.</p>



<p><strong><u>Requirements</u></strong>:</p>



<ul>
<li>Service site – Take not of the website you want to use the number in e.g. paypal.com
<ul>
<li><a href="HTTPS://WCC-AUTOSHOP.CC" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Wcc </a>Username – You will need to be an active wcc user with at least one purchase or balance on your account</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>For easy demonstration, I will register Amazon.com using our SMS gateway. Also, since you can also register one phone number once to a site, we will save this number for you so you can use it for the site you registered whenever you want. This will help you if for example the site sends otp to verify sign in.</p>



<p>Site: htttps://www.bitrefill.com</p>



<p><strong>Steps</strong>:</p>



<p>Like I mentioned, you must be a <a href="HTTPS://WCC-AUTOSHOP.CC" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">wcc </a>user to use this service, so the first step is to show you how to register</p>



<ol type="1">
<li>Create a <a href="HTTPS://WCC-AUTOSHOP.CC" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">WCC </a>Free Account</li>
</ol>



<p>Go to <strong>wcc-<a href="HTTPS://WCC-AUTOSHOP.CC" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">autoshop</a>.su</strong> and create a new account, fill your email and create password.<br>Use this link to avoid <strong>scam</strong> sites: <a href="https://wcc-plug.su" target="_blank" rel="noopener external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external" class="wpel-icon-right">https://wcc-plug.su<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>&nbsp; . Do not <strong>search</strong> for results. Account creation is <strong>free</strong> but make sure you top up your account in a day to avoid suspension.&nbsp;<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  decoding="async" width="1024" height="375" src="data:image/gif,GIF89a%01%00%01%00%80%00%00%00%00%00%FF%FF%FF%21%F9%04%01%00%00%00%00%2C%00%00%00%00%01%00%01%00%00%02%01D%00%3B" data-layzr="https://cardingsecrets.su/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Phone-service-2-1024x375.png" alt="sms otp bot" class="wp-image-1851"/></figure>



<p>Once you have created account, head to services and select phone number service</p>



<p>We have just created the account and we don’t have any balance, to access this service, we need to have topped up. Using the SMS service is free and won’t deduct any balance from your funds.</p>



<ul>
<li>Top Up Your Account</li>
</ul>



<p>Now we have an account, next we will add btc to our account, you can use the funds to buy fullz, bank logs, get drop address etc.</p>



<p>Go to balance tab<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img  decoding="async" width="905" height="279" src="data:image/gif,GIF89a%01%00%01%00%80%00%00%00%00%00%FF%FF%FF%21%F9%04%01%00%00%00%00%2C%00%00%00%00%01%00%01%00%00%02%01D%00%3B" data-layzr="https://cardingsecrets.su/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/CARDING-BALANCE.png" alt="Carding balance" class="wp-image-1854"/></figure>



<p>Currently We have 0, just hit Add Funds button and you will be presented with supported cryptos to add.</p>



<p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img  decoding="async" src="data:image/gif,GIF89a%01%00%01%00%80%00%00%00%00%00%FF%FF%FF%21%F9%04%01%00%00%00%00%2C%00%00%00%00%01%00%01%00%00%02%01D%00%3B" data-layzr="https://cardingsecrets.su/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/WCC-plug.su-add-funds.png" alt="Add funds wcc" class="wp-image-1857"/></figure>



<p>I have a bitcoin wallet and got some btc I can add to the site, So I chose bitcoin. Next, we will be offered with and address to send to.</p>



<p>Just copy the address and send the minimum as stated in the instructions. In my case, it was $150.</p>



<p>Send your crypto and click on I have paid button</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img  decoding="async" width="527" height="613" src="data:image/gif,GIF89a%01%00%01%00%80%00%00%00%00%00%FF%FF%FF%21%F9%04%01%00%00%00%00%2C%00%00%00%00%01%00%01%00%00%02%01D%00%3B" data-layzr="https://cardingsecrets.su/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/i-have-paid-wcc.png" alt="WCC PAY BUTTON" class="wp-image-1858"/></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  decoding="async" width="1024" height="242" src="data:image/gif,GIF89a%01%00%01%00%80%00%00%00%00%00%FF%FF%FF%21%F9%04%01%00%00%00%00%2C%00%00%00%00%01%00%01%00%00%02%01D%00%3B" data-layzr="https://cardingsecrets.su/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/blockchain-explorer-wcc-1024x242.png" alt="Explorer WCC-PLUG.CC" class="wp-image-1859"/></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Once the transaction is verified on blockchain, you can check your wallet for confirmations and once you receive 2 confirmations or more, your <a href="HTTPS://WCC-AUTOSHOP.CC" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">wcc </a>balance top-up will be confirmed and added</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img  decoding="async" width="714" height="262" src="data:image/gif,GIF89a%01%00%01%00%80%00%00%00%00%00%FF%FF%FF%21%F9%04%01%00%00%00%00%2C%00%00%00%00%01%00%01%00%00%02%01D%00%3B" data-layzr="https://cardingsecrets.su/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/carding-transaction-confirmed.png" alt="Carding confirmed wcc" class="wp-image-1860"/></figure>



<p>Now when you visit your balance tab, you will find your balance added and currency in USD. Now you can use this balance to buy anything offered in the site.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img  decoding="async" width="855" height="197" src="data:image/gif,GIF89a%01%00%01%00%80%00%00%00%00%00%FF%FF%FF%21%F9%04%01%00%00%00%00%2C%00%00%00%00%01%00%01%00%00%02%01D%00%3B" data-layzr="https://cardingsecrets.su/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/balance.png" alt="Balance" class="wp-image-1861"/></figure>



<p>You can also withdraw the balance, but not more than half. But the best way is to buy fullz and Cashout into btc. You can visit cardingsecrets.su to check some of the best Cashout methods</p>



<ul>
<li>Visit Site to register using phone<br></li>
</ul>



<p>Now as I mentioned earlier, I will be using amazon to demonstrate how to use the SMS methods in <a href="HTTPS://WCC-AUTOSHOP.CC" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">wcc</a></p>



<p>I will be using the US version since I will be using the phone number in the US. First, I will register with email and password and later I will add a phone number</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img  decoding="async" src="data:image/gif,GIF89a%01%00%01%00%80%00%00%00%00%00%FF%FF%FF%21%F9%04%01%00%00%00%00%2C%00%00%00%00%01%00%01%00%00%02%01D%00%3B" data-layzr="https://cardingsecrets.su/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/wcc-plug.su-sign-in.png" alt="sign in WCC-plug.su" class="wp-image-1862"/></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img  decoding="async" width="425" height="403" src="data:image/gif,GIF89a%01%00%01%00%80%00%00%00%00%00%FF%FF%FF%21%F9%04%01%00%00%00%00%2C%00%00%00%00%01%00%01%00%00%02%01D%00%3B" data-layzr="https://cardingsecrets.su/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Create-account-2.png" alt="Create account WCC" class="wp-image-1865"/></figure>



<p>This info is from a fullz I got on <a href="HTTPS://WCC-AUTOSHOP.CC" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">wcc</a>, the email I created using a free service. This is easy and just hit create account to proceed</p>



<p>There will be an otp sent to your email to verify it. So just copy and paste in the input field.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img  decoding="async" width="470" height="288" src="data:image/gif,GIF89a%01%00%01%00%80%00%00%00%00%00%FF%FF%FF%21%F9%04%01%00%00%00%00%2C%00%00%00%00%01%00%01%00%00%02%01D%00%3B" data-layzr="https://cardingsecrets.su/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/verify-mail-wcc.png" alt="verify mail wcc" class="wp-image-1866"/></figure>



<ul>
<li>Getting the phone number from <a href="HTTPS://WCC-AUTOSHOP.CC" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">wcc</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Next Amazon will ask for a phone number to verify. We’ll go Back to <a href="HTTPS://WCC-AUTOSHOP.CC" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">wcc </a>and to services again and since we already have topped up our account, we can use the 20 SMS verification offered daily for free<br><br><br><br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  decoding="async" width="1024" height="561" src="data:image/gif,GIF89a%01%00%01%00%80%00%00%00%00%00%FF%FF%FF%21%F9%04%01%00%00%00%00%2C%00%00%00%00%01%00%01%00%00%02%01D%00%3B" data-layzr="https://cardingsecrets.su/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/getting-phone-number-wcc-1024x561.png" alt="Getting phone number" class="wp-image-1867"/></figure>



<p>Next select from supported countries the phone number you want, I will choose US phone number<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img  decoding="async" width="951" height="128" src="data:image/gif,GIF89a%01%00%01%00%80%00%00%00%00%00%FF%FF%FF%21%F9%04%01%00%00%00%00%2C%00%00%00%00%01%00%01%00%00%02%01D%00%3B" data-layzr="https://cardingsecrets.su/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/select-country.png" alt="carding phone number" class="wp-image-1869"/></figure>



<p>When you click on the United States name, A button for select country will popup and just hit the button</p>



<p>Next click on generate button which will pop up when you click select country<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img  decoding="async" width="901" height="103" src="data:image/gif,GIF89a%01%00%01%00%80%00%00%00%00%00%FF%FF%FF%21%F9%04%01%00%00%00%00%2C%00%00%00%00%01%00%01%00%00%02%01D%00%3B" data-layzr="https://cardingsecrets.su/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/generate.png" alt="generate" class="wp-image-1868"/></figure>



<p>The system will generate a phone number with location details which you can use to register you site with</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img  decoding="async" width="325" height="156" src="data:image/gif,GIF89a%01%00%01%00%80%00%00%00%00%00%FF%FF%FF%21%F9%04%01%00%00%00%00%2C%00%00%00%00%01%00%01%00%00%02%01D%00%3B" data-layzr="https://cardingsecrets.su/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Details.png" alt="Details" class="wp-image-1870"/></figure>



<p>Make sure to type the service name in the input field and verify. This will check if the phone has already been used to register the site and if true, you will be given a different number not registered with your service.</p>



<ul>
<li>Continue registering Amazon</li>
</ul>



<p>Now we have a phone number to use, we will go back to amazon and input the number</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img  decoding="async" width="459" height="421" src="data:image/gif,GIF89a%01%00%01%00%80%00%00%00%00%00%FF%FF%FF%21%F9%04%01%00%00%00%00%2C%00%00%00%00%01%00%01%00%00%02%01D%00%3B" data-layzr="https://cardingsecrets.su/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/add-mobile-number-1.png" alt="sms bot carding" class="wp-image-1872"/></figure>



<p>Make sure You used proxies to match the country of the phone number you want to use.</p>



<p>Next, we click add mobile number and wait for the otp to be sent</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img  decoding="async" width="443" height="409" src="data:image/gif,GIF89a%01%00%01%00%80%00%00%00%00%00%FF%FF%FF%21%F9%04%01%00%00%00%00%2C%00%00%00%00%01%00%01%00%00%02%01D%00%3B" data-layzr="https://cardingsecrets.su/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/add-mobile-number-2.png" alt="OTP BOT" class="wp-image-1873"/></figure>



<p>Now when the otp is sent, you will get the otp in the <strong><a href="HTTPS://WCC-AUTOSHOP.CC" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">wcc </a>panel</strong> where you got the number. The otp is displayed <strong>as soon as it is sent by your service</strong> so you don’t have to wait a lot of time to prevent the otp that doesn’t long enough to expire</p>



<p>Now head back to <a href="HTTPS://WCC-AUTOSHOP.CC" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">wcc </a>to copy the otp. The otp are listed in order as they are generated. In my case this is the first otp under amazon so it’s labelled <strong>otp1</strong></p>
