Dumps and Cloned Cards are two of the most popular tools used for Carding, and in this video I&#8217;ll break down how they work. In short, a cloned card is an exact copy of an existing credit card. You can use it for all the same things, like withdrawing money from ATMs or making large purchases at stores. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The benefit of buying from a vendor like <a href=\"https:\/\/777dumps.ru\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">777dumps.ru<\/a> is that you don&#8217;t have to worry about getting all the software, hardware and other equipment yourself. However, if you&#8217;re savvy enough to get dumps yourself by skimming them (a process where you physically skim cards), then you don&#8217;t need to wait 72 hours for cards to be shipped out &#8211; plus it&#8217;s free! But be aware that getting the right equipment needed for Carding can set you back around $1500 &amp; the feds hate people that skim even more than people that cash out the dumps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Skimming_Vs_Cashing_out_dumps_The_law\"><\/span>Skimming Vs Cashing out dumps : The law<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Skimming: According to the law, This crime is considered to be more serious than cashing out card details, because it involves deceptive theft on an even larger scale. Instead of obtaining card details from one cardholder at a time; skimming dumps involve collecting data from multiple cardholders in one go with the help of an illegal card readers. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"prevent_card_cloning\"><\/span>prevent card cloning<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s easy for criminals to take advantage of cluttered public spaces like subway stations and retail stores to break into card Readers unnoticed, making them even more damaging to unsuspecting customers who have their bank accounts compromised. To protect yourself from this type of crime, make sure you stay away from any suspicious card readers in public areas, and if necessary use specialized protective devices like Anti-Skim Covers wherever appropriate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"the_art_of_turning_blank_cards_to_cloned_cards\"><\/span>the art of turning blank cards to cloned cards.<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you want to write your own Dumps + Pins? <a href=\"https:\/\/cardingsecrets.su\/write-dump-and-pin\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">(Click here)<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/cardingsecrets.su\/category\/dumps-and-pins\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">More on Dumps + Pin (Cloned Cards)<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow us on telegram: <a href=\"https:\/\/t.me\/cardingsecretsru\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Click here<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Welcome Carders, For those of you who don&#8217;t know, &#8220;dumps&#8221; are stolen credit card information that is encoded onto a new card, and &#8220;cloning&#8221; is the process of duplicating this information onto a blank card.
