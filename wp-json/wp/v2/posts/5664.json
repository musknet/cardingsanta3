Make sure to use a VPN and other anonymization tools, so you can stay safe online. <a href=\"https:\/\/cardingsecrets.su\/how-to-stay-anonymous\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">click here for a guide on staying anonymous<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Not_Knowing_the_Law\"><\/span>Not Knowing the Law: <span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Carding isn&#8217;t exactly legal in most parts of the world. Make sure you&#8217;re aware of all of your local laws before engaging in any carder activities so that you can stay on the right side of the law. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Not_Being_Patient\"><\/span>Not Being Patient: <span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to making payments, never copy and paste your Credit Card information.

Always manually enter your Credit Card information for safe and secure payments. Don&#8217;t take the risk of your payment being denied &#8211; enter it manually! It&#8217;s the safest way to guarantee a successful payment. So the next time you&#8217;re making a payment, remember: no copy and pasting! Enter it manually for safe and secure payments every time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Patience is key when it comes to carding.
