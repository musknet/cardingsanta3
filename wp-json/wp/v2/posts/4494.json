If you&#8217;re a carder, you need to know how to encrypt your hard drive with VeraCrypt to protect your information while you&#8217;re on the move. Here&#8217;s a quick guide on how to do it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What is VeraCrypt?<\/strong><br>VeraCrypt is a free, open-source disk encryption software that can be used to encrypt your hard drive. It&#8217;s one of the most popular disk encryption tools available, and it&#8217;s trusted by security professionals around the world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How Does it Work?<\/strong><br>VeraCrypt works by creating an encrypted virtual drive that sits on top of your existing hard drive. Any data that you put into this virtual drive will be automatically encrypted, and only someone with the correct decryption key will be able to access it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why use veracrypt?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many reasons why you might want to use VeraCrypt, but the most important reason is security. If your hard drive is encrypted, then even if someone physical gets their hands on it, they won&#8217;t be able to access your data. This is essential for anyone who deals with sensitive information, like carders.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another benefit of VeraCrypt is that it&#8217;s relatively easy to use. Unlike some other disk encryption tools, VeraCrypt doesn&#8217;t require any special knowledge or skills to set up and use. Anyone can do it, which makes it ideal for people who aren&#8217;t particularly tech-savvy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vercacrypt can be obtained by visiting&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/veracrypt.fr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https:\/\/veracrypt.fr<\/a>  The most common way to use VeraCrypt is to create an encrypted volume (file) and then store files inside the volume that need to be encrypted. Steps have been provided below for the creation and mounting of a VeraCrypt volume.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Creating a VeraCrypt Volume<\/li><li>Mounting a VeraCrypt Volume<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h1 id=\"creating_veracrypt\">Creating a VeraCrypt Volume<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>1. Open up the VeraCrypt application and select &#8220;<strong>Create Volume<\/strong>&#8220;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img  decoding=\"async\" src=\"data:image\/gif,GIF89a%01%00%01%00%80%00%00%00%00%00%FF%FF%FF%21%F9%04%01%00%00%00%00%2C%00%00%00%00%01%00%01%00%00%02%01D%00%3B\" data-layzr=\"https:\/\/security.vt.edu\/content\/dam\/security_vt_edu\/images\/veracrypt\/vc1.png\" alt=\"vc1\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>2.

This will associate the volume with the VeraCrypt application.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img  decoding=\"async\" src=\"data:image\/gif,GIF89a%01%00%01%00%80%00%00%00%00%00%FF%FF%FF%21%F9%04%01%00%00%00%00%2C%00%00%00%00%01%00%01%00%00%02%01D%00%3B\" data-layzr=\"https:\/\/security.vt.edu\/content\/dam\/security_vt_edu\/images\/veracrypt\/vc3.png\" alt=\"vc3\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>4. VeraCrypt provides some options for encryption. Select the desired encryption algorithms and select \u201c<strong>Next<\/strong>\u201d. VeraCrypt uses the AES algorithm by default and is recommended for selection.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Note: In most cases a 500mb size volume is suitable.
